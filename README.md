**DATA VISUALIZATION USING TABLEAU**

This project uses SQL Server to create four tables from the main dataset (CovidDeaths.xlsx) to then create four different visualizations in Tableau.

Types of visualizations:

1. Global Numbers. A table that contains the total cases, total deaths and death percentage from all the data.
2. Total Deaths Per Continent. Bar chart displaying total deaths count per continent.
3. Percentage People Infected Per Country. Map chart with a gradient color depending on the percentage of people infected in the country.
4. Percentage Population Infected. Line chart displaying population infected over time.
